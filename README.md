# Dua-Challenge-iOS
A challenge app used to generate and show random teams, fixtures and standings

SHORT SUMMARY
The app is a soccer league management tool that generates 20 unique soccer teams and simulates fixtures and results. 
It allows users to view the teams ordered by their points in a table view. 
The app focuses on the logic and functionality rather than complex UI design elements.

Each team has properties such as name, points, and additional attributes. 
The fixtures are generated to ensure that each team plays every other team twice, both home and away. 
Random goal scores determine the winners or draws, and the teamsâ€™ points are updated accordingly. 
The TeamStandingsController displays the teams in descending order based on their points, showing team names, points, and additional attributes. 
Users can tap on a team cell to view more details about the team. 

The app's code is organized following Swift best practices, with appropriate classes and methods. 
Code comments are included to explain key sections, and this brief documentation provides an overview of the challenge and specific instructions.
